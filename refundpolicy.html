    <h1>Return Policy for NeptuneIO</h1>

    <li>
        <p><strong>Billing and Cancellation</strong>
            <br><br><span class="underline">Billing Cycle</span> The membership fee for the NeptuneIO service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees,
            will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the
            service. Membership fees are fully earned upon payment. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership
            began on a day not contained in a given month. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various  methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your NeptuneIO membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.<br><br>3.2. <span class="underline">Payment Methods.</span> To use the NeptuneIO service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription
            fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service
            until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Check
            with your Payment Method service provider for details.
            <br><br>3.3 <span class="underline">Updating your Payment Methods.</span> You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the
            payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).
            <br><br>3.4. <span class="underline">Cancellation.</span> You can cancel your NeptuneIO membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the NeptuneIO service through the end of your billing period. To cancel, go to
            the "Account" page on our website and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account
            will close, click "Billing details" on the "Account" page. If you signed up for Netflix using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Netflix membership, you may need to do
            so through that third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the Netflix service through that third party. <br><br>3.5. <span class="underline">Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans.</span>                        We reserve the right to change our subscription plans or adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly
            provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes or changes to your subscription plan will take effect following notice to you.
            <br><br>3.6. <span class="underline">No Refunds.</span> Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used membership periods. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access
            to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). The amount and form
            of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to
            provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.
